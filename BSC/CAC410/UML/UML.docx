Object Interactions:
    The UML design is centered around the Client, 
    who selects the level of the employee 
    and is charged per hour based on that level. 
    Once the timecard is filled out with start and end times, 
    the bill is calculated based on the specific rate 
    determined by the employee's level. 
    The Client will be responsible for paying the calculated bill.

Allowed Object Actions:
    The Timecard can be edited and added by both the Client and Employee, 
    reflecting the start and end times worked. 
    The Client's information cannot be changed as it is the main class. 
    The Employee's name and ID cannot be altered, but their rate can be modified 
    by the Bill class and the Client's choice. The Bill itself can be modified by all three objects.

Visibility of Object Parts:
    The Bill is only visible to the Client. The Client can view the Employee's information, 
    but the Employee's ID number is not accessible for changes. 
    The Timecard is visible to both the Client and Employee.
