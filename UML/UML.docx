Determine what can be done to each object:
I wanted the UML design to be based upon the Client. as the client picks what level according to employee
they are charged per hour depending on the employee level. Once the timecard is filed out from start to end
time the bill will be calcualated accroding to the spefic rate depending on the level that then later the 
client will be charged with that they will have to pay for. 

Determin ehwat each object is allowed to do to other objects.
Timecard is able to be changed and added according to the client and employee timecard from the start and end time.
The client can not be changed as its attributed is the main class.
The employee can not change its name and id but the rate can be changed from bill.java as well as the client on who they choice.
The bill can be changed by all three objects.

Determine the parts of each object that will be visiable to other objects. 
The bill would only be visbale to the client
the client can view the employee infomration 
no one can change idNumber
the timecard can be visable by the client and employee.
