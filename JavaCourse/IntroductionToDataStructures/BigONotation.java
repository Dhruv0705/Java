Complexity Analysis

    As Programmers, we often find ourselves asking
        the same questions:
    
        How much times does the algorithm take/
            needs to finish?
        
        How much space does this algorithm need
            for its computation?

    Big-O Notation

        Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the
            complexity in the worst case, helping
            to quantify performance as the input size
            becomes arbitrarily larger.
