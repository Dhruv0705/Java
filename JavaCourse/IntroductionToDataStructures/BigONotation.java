Complexity Analysis

    As Programmers, we often find ourselves asking
        the same questions:
    
        How much times does the algorithm take/
            needs to finish?
        
        How much space does this algorithm need
            for its computation?

    Big-O Notation:

        Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the
            complexity in the worst case, helping
            to quantify performance as the input size
            becomes arbitrarily larger.

        Time:

            Time Complexity
                is the execution time it take for the
                    algorithm to solve a problem. To 
                    measure time complexity is used 
                    through Big O Notation in order
                    of the program.
        Types of Big O Notations:

            n - represents the size of the input
                complexity ordered from fastest - worses
                time complexity to execute a program. 
            
            Constant Time:      O(1)
            Logarithmic Time:   O(Log(n))
            Linear-Time:        O(n)
            Logarithmic Time:   O(nLog(n))
            Quadratic-Time:     O(n^2)
            Cubic Time:         O(n^3)
            Exponential Time:   O(x^n), b>1
            Factorial Time:     O(n!)
