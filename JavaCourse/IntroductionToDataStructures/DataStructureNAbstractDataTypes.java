        What is a Data Structure?

            A Data Structure (DS) is a way of organizing
                data so that it can be used effectively.
    
        Why Data Structures? 
    
            They are essential ingredients in creating
                fast and powerful algorithms.
            They help in managing and organizing data by
                making code cleaner and easier to understand.

        Abstract Data Type

            An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstraction
                of a data structure which provides only the
                interface to which a data structure most
                adheres to. 
            The interface does not give any specific details
                about how something should be implemented
                or in what programming language.

        Types:

            Abstraction (ADT):      Implementation(DS):
            
            List:                   Dynamic Array
                                    Linked List

            Queue:                  Linked List Based Queue
                                    Array Based Queue
                                    Stack Based Queue
            
            Map:                    Tree Map
                                    Hash Map / Hash Table
            
            EX:
            Vehicle:                Bicycle
                                    Golf Cart
                                    Truck                        
        */
    }
